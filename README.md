# EDA-Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and identify the key factors influencing the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by leveraging health-related data. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support healthcare providers and insurance companies in better understanding risk profiles, enabling proactive medical intervention and tailored treatment plans. Additionally, the project seeks to assist insurance providers in risk assessment and premium structuring based on individual health indicators.

Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations, the project will answer critical questions related to age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and comorbid conditions (such as hypertension and heart disease) and their association with diabetes. Ultimately, this project will uncover patterns and trends in the data, with the goal of enabling more informed decision-making in preventive healthcare and insurance modeling.
This project is to analyze, interpret, and visualize health-related data to uncover meaningful insights into the factors influencing diabetes risk. This involves identifying key variables—such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and medical history—and determining their correlation or impact on diabetes occurrence.

By applying statistical analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques, the goal is to answer specific business and clinical questions that can guide healthcare professionals in predictive diagnosis and personalized treatment plans, and help insurance companies in risk assessment and policy development.

Ultimately, the project aims to deliver data-driven recommendations and clear visual narratives that support strategic decision-making and promote proactive health management.
